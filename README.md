6. data
    This folder acts as target /data folder where stores all the files throughout the tasks. 

One pull request: 
1. After uploading the Python code for Task 1 - 4, I went back to proofread my work and found that there were multiple points for one ntacode. Since the Neighborhood Tabulation Area boundaries imply that these points should enclose an area, it would be more appropriate to perform a spatial join of the sample_311 location points inside these boundary lines in order to obtain the matching ntacode. Additional details and the process for doing so are included in the notebook.
2. As an associate data engineer, I believe it would be beneficial to discuss this issue with the team and potentially consider emailing the Office of Planning for further guidance.
